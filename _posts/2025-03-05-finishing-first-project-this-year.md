# Current Project Update

Hello there, remember the htmx-helper project that we start last month. I just finished it today. It took longer than my estimation as I am occupied with a lot of things currently. I completed the project and publish it in github.

I think it gave me a really good introduction to things needed in implementing a local LLM without API and Implementing a RAG system from scratch. Note that we can use framework such as langchain to implement this RAG pipeline but we will loss the understanding of it. Therefore, for learning purpose, this project managed to starts and ends beautifully.

With that I can safely tied up this project.

# Next

- I just finished enrolling for the next semester, so we will start my new semester in UM later this month.
- I just reached out to new lecturer hoping to be a great FYP supervisor that could also potentially give me an FYP topics that are closely related to industrial setting
- Im looking to start a new mini-project on Agentic AI to help me learn, understand and implement it.

I think that's about it with my post today. Salam Ramadan
