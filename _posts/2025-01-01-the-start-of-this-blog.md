# My first Post

Hello there, this is the first time i'm writing a blog. Seems awkward if i'm being honest.

A little bit of what's going on with me right now, I just finished my exchange programs in Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, Japan. It felt surreal to attend one of the best university in Japan.

The feelings of excitement and drive to keep grinding is the most significance things that Japan left upon me. I'm gonna miss all of my international friends that i made as it will be hard for most of them to came to Malaysia.

Also, today is actually 1/1/2025, the first day of the year. Which is a coincidence as it also felt like a great day to start my blog. I hope this year will be a year full of progress. I would like to list some short term goals that i have so i could remember it well.

## Goals

- Finish 3 books on AI implementation.
- Create my own AI app and model with realtime data pipeline.
- Make a great FYP,
- Deploy an app with realtime data streaming.
- Exercise minimum 3 days a week.
- Learn 5 songs and improvisation with my guitar.
- Be consistent.
- Update significance events in this blog.

I think that's about it with my post today. I am not a good writer neither a good blogger. Hope I will be consistent with this blog.
